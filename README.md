# Playwright Automation Assessment

A Playwright automation project built with TypeScript, covering both UI automation and API testing using Page Object Model (POM) design for maintainability and readability.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates:

* UI end-to-end automation using Playwright
* API testing using Playwright request context
* Page Object Model (POM) implementation
* Test assertions for validation
* GitHub Actions CI workflow integration

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* Playwright
* TypeScript
* Node.js
* Visual Studio Code

## ✅ UI Test Coverage

UI automation includes:

* Login flow
* Product selection
* Cart validation
* Checkout process
* Order completion verification

Implemented using Page Object Model to separate page actions and assertions.

---

## ✅ API Test Coverage

API testing includes:

* GET request validation
* POST request creation
* PUT / PATCH update verification
* DELETE request execution

Tested against JSONPlaceholder mock API.

> Note: JSONPlaceholder simulates successful updates but does not persist server-side changes.

## ▶ Prerequisites

Clone the repository

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
npx install playwright
```

## ▶ Run Project
Run all tests:

```bash
npx playwright test
```

Run UI tests only:

```bash
npx playwright test tests/MainTest.spec.ts
```

Run API tests only:

```bash
npx playwright test tests/APITest.spec.ts
```

Run tests in headed mode (to see browser):

```bash
npx playwright test --headed
```

---

## 📊 Generate Report

```bash
npx playwright show-report
```

---

## 🚀 CI Integration

GitHub Actions workflow is included for automated test execution.

---

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting (Windows PowerShell Execution Policy)

If PowerShell blocks Playwright commands with:

```bash
npx : File C:\Program Files\nodejs\npx.ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system.
```

Run commands using Execution Policy Bypass:

```bash
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "npx playwright test tests/MainTest.spec.ts"
```

For report generation:

```bash
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "npx playwright show-report"
```

> This issue happens because PowerShell script execution is restricted by default on some Windows environments.

📌 Future Improvements
* JSON test data parameterization
* Advanced API validation scenarios
* Retry and reporting enhancement
